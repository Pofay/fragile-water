# FragileWater

This Elixir Project is my follow along of [Pikdum's](https://github.com/pikdum) Elixir implementation of his [Thistle Tea Wow Server](https://github.com/pikdum/thistle_tea) from these sources:

- [Pikdum's Blog](https://pikdum.dev/)
- Github commits

Like him I want to learn more about Elixir and its ecosystem and experiment with the language.

Instead of using the original [MangosZero](https://github.com/mangoszero) I opted to use [CMangos](https://github.com/cmangos) specifically its [Burning Crusade expansion](https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc) since it was easier to setup.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fragile_water` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fragile_water, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/fragile_water>.
